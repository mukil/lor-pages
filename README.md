# About LOR-Pages

The LOR-Pages assemble, polish and publish 3 datasets containing anonymous statistical information on the inhabitants of  Berlin, Germany. These datasets are published on 1 page per LOR, while an LOR contains roughly up to 40 000 inhabitants and thus presents you information about a very small area, like a block or street in Berlin.

# Technology

The data of the LOR-Pages comes from simple .CSV-files. The rows in the dataset are parsed, structured and statistically polished with PHP. The presentation of the stats is done in simple HTML in tables along with some JavaScript and the cross-browser vector graphics library raphael.

# Licenses
